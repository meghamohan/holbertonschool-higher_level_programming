##About Python

- Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
- Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
- Python is Interactive: You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
- Portable: Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.

###More about Python
- Where does the name 'Python' come from?
It apparently seems, Guido van Rossum, the author of Python Programming Language was reading the first published draft script of “Monty Python's Flying Circus”, a 70s BBC Comedy. He wanted a short succinct name for the language and his love for Monty Python was the reason for naming the language Python.
- What is the Zen of Python?
The Zen of Python is a collection of 20 software principles that influences the design of Python Programming Language, — only 19 of which were written down — around June 1999 by Tim Peters.
